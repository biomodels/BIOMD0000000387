**Abstract:**   
The Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) provides the precursors for biomass synthesis
necessary for plant growth. The dynamic behavior and yield of the CBC depend
on the environmental conditions and regulation of the cellular state. Accurate
quantitative models hold the promise of identifying the key determinants of
the tightly regulated CBC function and their effects on the responses in
future climates. We provide an integrative analysis of the largest compendium
of existing models for photosynthetic processes. Based on the proposed
ranking, our framework facilitates the discovery of best-performing models
with regard to metabolomics data and of candidates for metabolic engineering.

**Note:** Model of the Calvin cycle with focus on the RuBisCO reaction by Damour and Urban (2007, [[for PDF click here]](http://algorithmicbotany.org/FSPM07/Individual/15.pdf) ). 

The parameter values are partly taken from Farquhar et al. (1980,
[DOI:10.1007/BF00386231](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00386231) ) and Urban et
al. (2003,
[DOI:10.1093/treephys/23.5.289](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.5.289)
). The initial metabolite values are chosen from the data set of Zhu et al.
(2007, [DOI:10.1104/pp.107.103713](http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.103713) ).
A detailed description of all modifications is given in the model described by
Arnold and Nikoloski (2011,
